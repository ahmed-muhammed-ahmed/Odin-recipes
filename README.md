# Odin Recipes Project

## Overview

This project is a simple web development exercise that focuses on creating a recipe website called "Odin Recipes." The project is organized into several iterations, each building upon the previous one to enhance the structure and content of the website.

## Project Structure

- **Iteration 1: Initial Structure**
  - Created the `index.html` file with basic HTML structure and added an `<h1>` heading with the title "Odin Recipes."

- **Iteration 2: Recipe Page**
  - Created a new `recipes` directory.
  - Added a new HTML file within the `recipes` directory, e.g., `air_fryer_meatloaf.html`, with an `<h1>` heading for the recipe.
  - Linked the recipe page to the `index.html` file.

- **Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content**
  - Enhanced the recipe page with:
    - An image of the finished dish.
    - A "Description" section with a brief paragraph describing the recipe.
    - An "Ingredients" section with an unordered list.
    - A "Steps" section with an ordered list.

- **Iteration 4: Add More Recipes**
  - Added two additional recipes (`oven_fried_chicken.html` and `turkey_in_a_bag.html`) with identical structures.
  - Linked the new recipes to the `index.html` file.
  - Organized recipe links in an unordered list for improved readability.
